# NtripStreams
=======================

[![Linting Code Base](https://github.com/stenseng/ntripstreams/actions/workflows/linter.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/stenseng/ntripstreams/actions/workflows/linter.yml)

NtripStreams provide methods for communicating using the Ntrip protocol.

The intent is rather to provide simple and logical methods to communicate with GNSS receivers and GNSS casters than provide high performance efficient methods.
